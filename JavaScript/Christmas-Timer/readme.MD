## About The Project

[Project Demo](https://diwali-countdown-app.netlify.app/)

This is a Countdown timer app made using Vanilla JS.
For this app I have used HTML , CSS for basic frontend and then made it functionable so as to show the exact time in `Days:Hours:Minutes:Seconds` left before Diwali.

> P.S : You can change the timer to whatever occasion you like by changing the date in `app.js`.
